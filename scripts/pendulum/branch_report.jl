# branch_report.jl — the evaluation table every pendulum SAE run should be read through
#
# Takes any weights file and reports, per regime AND per branch of the cylinder:
#
#   J_angular   the true action, analytic
#   J_latent    the latent loop's enclosed area, which is exactly ∮ p·dq of the decoded loop
#               because the decoder is symplectic and globally defined on the plane
#   gap         |J_latent - J_angular| / J_angular
#   recon       relative reconstruction error of that level set, on its exact orbit sampled
#               uniformly in time (reconstruction_error.jl)
#   nested      whether this level's image lies wholly on one side of the level before it
#   simple      whether the image is a Jordan curve
#
# Why per branch. Above the separatrix each energy carries two orbits, p_θ > 0 and p_θ < 0, and they
# are separate loops around the cylinder. The base grid contains only the p_θ < 0 one
# (its momenta are the fractions {0, ±2/5, ±3/4, −1, −2, −3} of the separatrix momentum, so every
# |f| > 1 is negative). A number aggregated over both branches is meaningless: on a two-directional
# grid one of them is reproduced to a few percent and the other is ~93% off, and that is not a
# training deficiency: an embedding of both rotating families into one plane has to nest one inside
# the other, so that family's enclosed areas stay bounded while its actions grow.
#
# Why the structural columns. If the encoder embeds the cylinder then its image is an open annulus,
# its complement has one bounded hole K, and every rotating image encloses K. Then:
#
#   * each image is a Jordan curve                            (injective continuous image of a circle)
#   * consecutive images are nested                           (disjoint orbits have disjoint images)
#   * enclosed areas keep one sign along the family, with magnitude bounded below by area(K)
#
# Exactly one of the two rotating families nests outward and grows; the other nests inward towards K
# and SHRINKS. Shrinking is therefore not a failure -- it is required of whichever family the chart
# puts on the inside. Only the three checks above are violations, and each is a certificate, by
# contraposition, that the map is not an embedding there. They need no ground-truth action and cost
# one forward pass per level set, which is what makes them worth running on every evaluation: a
# reconstruction error tells you the fit is poor, these tell you the chart has stopped being a chart.

# Environment:
#   SAE_WEIGHTS   <GML_OUTDIR>/pendulum_sae.h5   the file to evaluate
#   (the architecture, symplectic or standard, and its sizes are read from the file's attributes;
#    files without them hold the symplectic autoencoder at sympnet_upscale = 20)
#   SAE_NSAMP     1600             points per level set
#
# Needs GeometricMachineLearning 0.6 or newer, HDF5 and GeometricIntegrators (for the orbits of the
# reconstruction error). It does NOT need PoincareInvariants or CairoMakie: the invariant of a closed
# planar curve is its enclosed area, which is a shoelace sum.

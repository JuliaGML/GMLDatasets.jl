# structure_checks.jl — the embedding checks of `branch_report.jl`, as functions
#
# Included by `branch_report.jl`, which prints them per level, and by `train_sae.jl`, which runs them
# on every checkpoint so that a run can keep the weights that pass them. Why these three checks and
# not an accuracy number is explained in the header of `branch_report.jl`.
#
# Nothing here loads a network: every function takes the encoder as an argument.

"""
Walk a family in order and check each level's image. `frac` is the fraction of this level's image
inside the previous one: for an embedding every vertex of one curve lies on a single side of the
other, so it must come out 0% or 100%. Anything between is a crossing, and two disjoint orbits
with intersecting images is non-injectivity directly. Disjointness is not nesting, though: two images
side by side also give 0%. So `nest` records the direction, `:inward` (this image inside the previous
one, 100%), `:outward` (the previous image inside this one: 0%, and a vertex of the previous image has
nonzero winding about this one) or `:none`, and the family is nested only if every level has the
direction of the first. These are checks on sampled curves, evidence for an embedding, not a proof.

The orientation a family is traversed with is a convention -- the librating loops come out negative
here and the rotating ones positive -- so what an embedding forces is not a positive area but a
CONSTANT sign along the family. The first level's sign is the reference.

Returns one row per level and, for each check, the first level that fails it (`nothing` if none).

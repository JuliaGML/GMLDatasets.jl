# The reference phase portrait beside the trained encoder's latent space
#
# The encoded pendulum level sets of the symplectic-autoencoder paper. Both dynamical regimes,
# libration about theta = pi and rotation, with the separatrix that divides them.
#
# The rotating branch drawn is the p_theta < 0 one, which is the branch the training set contains.
# That is not cosmetic: drawn on the other branch the same weights give a picture in which the
# rotating curves do not enclose the chart at all but collapse into the small separatrix lobe and
# shrink. Which branch a latent figure draws has to be stated before any nesting is read off it.
#
# Level sets are drawn analytically rather than integrated: the encoder is a pointwise map, so the
# latent curve is exactly the image of the level set. That avoids integrator error and the
# wrap-around artifact of drawing a rotating orbit as one polyline in theta mod 2*pi.

# `@extref` links to the upstream API documentation. Each entry is the root URL of the deployed
# documentation, the inventory to read the anchors from, and a committed copy of that inventory to
# fall back on when the network is unavailable.
#
# The **trailing slash on the root URL is required**. `DocumenterInterLinks` concatenates the root
# with the relative URI the inventory records, so without it `DataLoader`'s
# `data_loader/data_loader/#$` becomes `.../latestdata_loader/data_loader/#...`, which is a 404 that
# nothing in the build checks: `@extref` resolution only verifies that the *name* is in the
# inventory, never that the assembled URL exists.
#
# Refresh the fallbacks with
#     julia -e 'using DocInventories; save("docs/inventories/<Name>.toml", Inventory(<url>; root_url = ""))'

# The trained weights the MNIST tutorial reads live in `docs/artifacts/` rather than under
# `docs/src/`, because Documenter copies everything in `src` verbatim into `build` and `deploydocs`
# then publishes it: 3 MB of HDF5 that only the build reads and no reader of the site ever
# downloads. They are inputs to the build, not part of it.
#
# The path travels through the environment because an `@setup` block cannot see anything defined
# here, and because the alternative -- a path relative to the block's working directory, which is
# the built page's own directory -- would silently break if the tutorial ever moved.
